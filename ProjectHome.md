A live wallpaper for android 2.1 that is a photo slide show. Can change on tap or on a timer.

I currently have other projects I want to work on, so I've open sourced this to let other people improve on it. It is GPL v2 so if you use the code and publish it, remember you have to publish your changes as well! I'd be interested in seeing improvements.

Also, I'd love to take any patches and release them if anyone has them.
